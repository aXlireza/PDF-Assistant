# PDF Assistant

## ```Take the Article Reading to the Next Level```

### Where it started?
I have developed parts necessary to generate voices and summeries out of a selected text already in my [Read-out-load-and-Summerize-Text
](https://github.com/aXlireza/Read-out-load-and-Summerize-Text) repo and now intending to integrate it into PDF reading experiance.

### Why even bother?
My challenge with PDF is most of the times, it's hard for me to start with reading from the top to bottom, I need to have a roadmap right before my eyes next to the actual PDF. For example, have the Headings next to each other with lines between them illustrating the connection of their context.

I need to have an idea where this article is going to be able to have a better and stronger grasp of the connection.

### How is it going to be of help?
Now, sometimes I need a summery of a long text or maybe a short text where I'm having a hard time understanding it, this is where another person reading the same paragraph can do a lot of help, even better? a summery of it! need more? a thumbnail visualizing what's going on or even break down of the context for you to see the connections!

# Progress Report
- Developed the system to convert PDF to JSON to organize the texts in there and prepare them for voice and summery generation and break down to smaller managable parts.
- Developed another system to convert the PDF to HTML which is doing an almost good job but not perfect.

```The important step after having the generative steps ready, is the interface to help focus better and easier on the article```

- In the attempt to develop a new interface by the organized text that was extracted from the PDF, for now, shall remove the small texts where they wouldn't be much of a help and maybe include it later to the related text by hovering maybe.

- An issue is the the vectors in the PDF, I am capable of extracting texts and images but some are apparently neither and can't extract them like the others.
  - Even when you try to setup your own interface, some images are not just image, there texts on the image and handling them all together is a bit of headache
