        "text": "he discovery of the double helix in 1953 immediately raised questions about how biological information is encoded in DNA. A remarkable feature of the structure is that DNA can accommodate almost any sequence of base pairs \u2014 any combination of the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) \u2014 and, hence any digital message or information. During the following decade it was discovered that each gene encodes a complementary RNA transcript, called messenger RNA (mRNA), made up of A, C, G and uracil (U), instead of T. The four bases of the DNA and RNA alphabets are related to the 20 amino acids of the protein alphabet by a triplet code \u2014 each three letters (or \u2018codons\u2019) in a gene encodes one amino acid. For example, AGT encodes the amino acid serine. The dictionary of DNA letters that make up the amino acids is called the genetic code. There are 64 different triplets or codons, 61 of which encode an amino acid (different triplets can encode the same amino acid), and three of which are used for \u2018punctuation\u2019 in that they signal the termination of the growing protein chain. The molecular complementary of the double helix \u2014 whereby each base on one strand of DNA pairs with its complementary base on the partner strand (A with T, and C with G) \u2014 has profound implications for biology. As implied by James Watson and Francis Crick in their landmark paper, base pairing suggests a template- copying mechanism that accounts for the fidelity in copying of genetic material during DNA replication (see article in this issue by Alberts, page 431). It also underpins the synthesis of mRNA from the DNA template, as well as processes of repairing damaged DNA (discussed by Friedberg, page 436).",

The first sequencing machine \u2014 invented by Leroy Hood, Lloyd Smith and Mike Hunkapiller in 1986 (ref. 12) \u2014 was automated in data acquisition, but still required substantial manual attention and the sequencing rate was low, roughly 250 bases per day. Over the next ten years, the development of automated DNA sequencing accelerated, rapidly passing through three distinct stages: the prototype sequenc- ing machine (1986); a robust instrument that could be used routinely in a standard laboratory (1989); and finally, a machine that formed part of an integrated factory-like production line where DNA sample preparation and sequencing were all fully automated (1998).

The goals of high-throughput biological instrumentation are to increase throughput, enhance the quality of the data, and greatly reduce the cost of per unit information acquired. To reach these goals in the future, the miniaturization, automation, parallelization and integration of successive procedures will propel DNA sequencing technology into the realm of microfluidics and microelectronics, and eventually into the area of nanotechnology. With single-DNA- molecule sequencing, we foresee a time when the entire genome of an individual could be sequenced in a single day at a cost of less than $US10,000 (compared with the US$50 million or more it would cost today).

        "text": "The value of having an entire genome sequence is that one can initiate the study of a biological system with a precisely definable digital core of information for that organism \u2014 a fully delineated genetic source code. The challenge, then, is in deciphering what information is encoded within the digital code. The genome encodes two main types of digital information \u2014 the genes that encode the protein and RNA molecular machines of life, and the regulatory networks that specify how these genes are expressed in time, space and amplitude. It is the evolution of the regulatory networks and not the genes themselves that play the critical role in making organisms different from one another. The digital information in genomes operates across three diverse time spans: evolution (tens to millions of years), development (hours to tens of years), and physiology (milliseconds to weeks). Development is the elaboration of an organism from a single cell (the fertilized egg) to an adult (for humans this is 10cells of thousands of different types). Physiology is the triggering of specific functional programmes (for example, the immune response) by environmental cues. Regulatory networks are crucial in each of these aspects of biology. Regulatory networks are composed of two main types of compo- nents: transcription factors and the DNA sites to which they bind in the control regions of genes, such as promoters, enhancers and silencers. The control regions of individual genes serve as information processors to integrate the information inherent in the concentrations of different transcription factors into signals that mediate gene expression. The collection of the transcription factors and their cognate DNA-binding sites in the control regions of genes that carry out a particular developmental or physiological function constitute these regulatory networks (Fig. 2). Because most \u2018higher\u2019 organisms or eukaryotes (organisms that contain their DNA in a cellular compartment called the nucleus), such as yeast, flies and humans, have predominantly the same families of genes, it is the reorganization of DNA-binding sites in the control regions of genes that mediate the changes in the developmen- tal programmes that distinguish one species from another. Thus, the regulatory networks are uniquely specified by their DNA-binding sites and, accordingly, are basically digital in nature. One thing that is striking about digital regulatory networks is that they can change significantly in short periods of evolutionary time. This is reflected, for example, in the huge diversity of the body plans, controlled by gene regulatory networks, that emerged over perhaps 10\u201330 million years during the Cambrian explosion of metazoan organisms (about 550 million years ago). Likewise, remarkable changes occurred to the regulatory networks driving the develop- ment of the human brain during its divergence from its common ancestor with chimpanzees about 6 million years ago. Biology has evolved several different types of informational hier- archies. First, a regulatory hierarchy is a gene network that defines the relationships of a set of transcription factors, their DNA-binding sites and the downstream peripheral genes that collectively control a par- ticular aspect of development. A model of development in the sea urchin represents a striking example(Fig. 2). Second, an evolution- ary hierarchy defines an order set of relationships, arising from DNA duplication. For example, a single gene may be duplicated to generate a multi-gene family, and a multi-gene family may be duplicated to create a supergene family. Third, molecular machines may be assem- bled into structural hierarchies by an ordered assembly process. One example of this is the basic transcription apparatus that involves the step-by-step recruitment of factors and enzymes that will ultimately drive the specific expression of a given gene. A second example is pro- vided by the ribosome, the complex that translates RNA into protein, which is assembled from more than 50 different proteins and a few RNA molecules. Finally, an informational hierarchy depicts the flow of information from a gene to environment: gene\u2192RNA\u2192protein\u2192protein interactions\u2192protein complexes\u2192networks of protein complexes in a cell\u2192tissues or organs\u2192individual organisms\u2192populations\u2192ecosystems. At each successively higher level in the informational hierarchy, information can be added or altered for any given element (for example, by alternative RNA splicing or protein modification).",

Hence, the signal (high affinity) is distinguished from the noise (low affini- ty). Moreover, high levels of mutation in the B cells causes specific diversification of antibody genes in the presence of antigen and permits the affinity to increase even more. The cells carrying the higher-affinity antibody genes are then preferentially selected for survival and proliferation. The key question is what and how much signal emerges from the noise. Analysis of stochastic events and the differentiation between signal and noise will be a future challenge for contemporary biology. The immune response has been studied for more than 100 years, yet we still have only a partial understanding of its systems properties, such as the immune response and tolerance (the unre- sponsiveness to one\u2019s own cells). This is because until recently immu- nologists have been able to study this complex system only one gene or one protein at a time. The systems approach permits the study of all elements in a sys- tem in response to genetic (digital) or environmental perturbations. Global quantitative analyses of biological information from different levels each provide new insights into the operation of the system; hence, information at as many levels as possible must be captured, integrated, and ultimately, modelled mathematically. The model should explain the properties of the system and establish a framework that allows us to redesign the system in a rational way to generate new emergent properties. Several systems have been explored successfully. The utilization of the sugar galactose in yeast has been analysed using genetic perturba- tions (inactivation of genes) and four levels of information were gathered \u2014 RNA and protein concentrations as well as protein\u2013 protein and protein\u2013DNA interactions. Using an iterative and integrative systems approach, new insights into the regulation of galactose use were gained.

Because there is more DNA in a eukaryote than in a prokaryote, it was naturally first assumed that the purpose of histones was to compress the DNA to fit within the nucleus. But subsequent research has dramatically revised the view that histones emerged as an afterthought, forced on eukaryotic DNA as a consequence of large genome size and the constraints of the nucleus. It was known that different genes are active in different tissues, and the distinction of heterochromatin and euchromatin suggested that differences in chromatin structure were associated with differences in gene expression. This led to the early supposition that the histones were also repressor proteins designed to shut off unwanted expression. The available evidence, although rudimenta- ry, does indeed suggest that archaeal histones are not merely packaging factors, but function to regulate gene expression. They",
